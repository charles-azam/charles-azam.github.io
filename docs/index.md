## 💼 What I Can Do

!!! tip "Specialization"
    Implementing cutting-edge tech tools in industries that aren’t used to them—bridging the gap between traditional engineering and modern software practices.

- **Engineering-as-Code**: Design and deploy custom code-driven platforms (like PyJimmy) to replace legacy PLM systems.
- **AI & Automation**: Build RAG workflows, agentic processes, and ML pipelines for smart decision support.
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Implement full-lifecycle pipelines with GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS.
- **Data Integration**: Unify simulations, models, and docs in a single repo for pure, reusable data.
- **Cloud Architecture**: Architect scalable, cost-efficient AWS solutions.
- **Team Enablement**: Define roadmaps, governance, and best practices to upskill engineering teams.


## 🔧 Open Source Projects

- **Pyforge**
  A minimalist Engineering-as-Code library for managing models, simulations, and docs in a Git workflow.
- **AIEngineer**
  An AI agent that scaffolds engineering projects based on Pyforge conventions.
- **DeepDraft**
  A follow-up to AIEngineer in my quest to understand AI.
- **Predibench**
  A platform for betting on AI agents.
- **Webportal**
  A web platform to help agent using the web.

I build AI systems for complex engineering and technical problems.

Currently building open-source tools for AI agents, prediction markets, and technical search. Previously led engineering teams at Jimmy Energy, transforming traditional workflows into code-driven systems.

## Featured Projects

**[Jimmy Energy: Engineering-as-Code Transformation](#)**
Led transformation of traditional engineering company to Git-based workflow. Replaced legacy PLM with Python tools, enabling AI integration and clean version control.

**[OmniAgents](https://github.com/charles-azam/OmniAgents)**
Unified interface for building AI coding agents across multiple environments (Local, Docker, E2B) and frameworks (smolagents, Pydantic-AI, LangChain).

**[Predibench](https://predibench.com)** • [Code](https://github.com/charles-azam/predibench)
Live platform benchmarking AI models on real-world prediction markets using Polymarket.

**[Webportal](https://webportal-468213.web.app)** • [Code](https://github.com/charles-azam/webportal)
Web platform for AI agent interaction. Follow up of the project at HuggingFace x Anthropic hackathon (**3rd place winner**).

**[Pyforge](https://github.com/charles-azam/pyforge)**
Minimalist Python library for engineering-as-code. Version control for engineering artifacts—models, simulations, docs.

**[AIEngineer](https://github.com/charles-azam/aiengineer)**
AI agent that scaffolds engineering projects following Pyforge conventions. Experimental. I knew nothing about AI when I started this project.

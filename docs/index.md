# Welcome

Hi, I‚Äôm **Charles Azam**, CIO & Software Engineer at **Jimmy Energy**. I build code-driven engineering platforms, harness AI & cloud technologies, and streamline workflows to empower teams. 


!!! success "Case Study: Jimmy Energy"  
    My team and I organized the entire engineering company on a single Git monorepo. By recoding our engineers‚Äô tools from the ground up, we now enjoy cleaner data and seamless AI integration.

## üíº What I Can Do

!!! tip "Specialization"
    Implementing cutting-edge tech tools in industries that aren‚Äôt used to them‚Äîbridging the gap between traditional engineering and modern software practices.

- **Engineering-as-Code**: Design & deploy custom code-driven platforms (like PyJimmy) to replace legacy PLM systems  
- **AI & Automation**: Build RAG workflows, agentic processes, and ML pipelines for smart decision support  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Implement full lifecycle pipelines with GitHub Actions, Docker & AWS  
- **Data Integration**: Unify simulations, models & docs in a single repo for pure, reusable data  
- **Cloud Architecture**: Architect scalable, cost-efficient AWS solutions  
- **Team Enablement**: Define roadmaps, governance & best practices to upskill engineering teams  


## üîß Open Source Projects

- **Pyforge**  
  A minimalist Engineering-as-Code library for managing models, simulations & docs in a Git workflow.
- **AIEngineer**  
  An AI agent that scaffolds engineering projects based on Pyforge conventions.

# About me

Hi, I'm **Charles Azam**. I build AI systems for complex engineering and technical problems.

I'm currently building open-source tools to push AI capabilities in complex domains: autonomous coding agents, prediction market evaluation, and scientific deep search. Previously, I led engineering teams at Jimmy Energy, transforming traditional engineering workflows into modern, code-driven systems.

**What drives me:** Most AI works on easy problems. I'm interested in making AI succeed at real engineering, scientific reasoning, and production systems.

## Featured Projects

!!! success "**Jimmy Energy: Engineering-as-Code Transformation**"
    As CIO, I led my team to reorganize an entire engineering company on a single Git monorepo. We rebuilt our engineers' tools from scratch, enabling cleaner data, version control, and seamless AI integration. Traditional PLM replaced with Python + Git. Also did a great RAG system to help our engineers find the information they need.

!!! info "**[OmniAgents](https://github.com/charles-azam/OmniAgents): Unified AI Coding Agent Interface**"
    A unified interface for building AI coding agents across multiple execution environments (Local, Docker, E2B) and AI frameworks (smolagents, Pydantic-AI, LangChain). Solves the fragmentation problem in AI agent development.

!!! info "**[Predibench](https://predibench.com): AI Agents on Prediction Markets**"
    A live platform benchmarking AI models on real-world forecasting using Polymarket. Tests whether AI can beat humans at predicting events. [Code](https://github.com/charles-azam/predibench)

!!! info "**[Webportal](https://webportal-468213.web.app): Web Interface for AI Agents**"
    Built during the HuggingFace x Anthropic hackathon (3rd place). A web platform designed to help AI agents interact with the web more effectively. [Code](https://github.com/aymeric-roucher/webportal)

# Projects

Welcome to my personal projects page.

Based on what I learned at Jimmy, I had an idea. We had already managed to do engineering using only open-source technologies like Python, Git, etc.

Now, what if I could use an AI agent to create an engineering project automatically?

To do that, I had to develop two independent repositories:

- [DeepDraft](https.www.deepdraft.dev): (Work in progress) An attempt at implementing a deep search specialized in scientific questions.
- [Pyforge](https://github.com/charles-azam/pyforge): A minimalist Python library for engineering as code.
- [AIEngineer](https://github.com/charles-azam/aiengineer): Since it is possible to do engineering as code, why not use an AI agent to generate it? I tried using Aider to programmatically generate code.

## Approach

**Understand the real problem**
Immersion in workflows. Identify high-impact opportunities.

Most companies will try to sell you their very generalistic solution. But each company has a very specific situation and to yield the best results, we need to understand the specific situation and to tailor the solution to the specific situation.

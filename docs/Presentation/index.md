## Profile  
Digital transformation specialist with a proven track record in engineering and scientific environments. Expertise in designing and deploying proprietary code-based platforms as alternatives to traditional PLM software (e.g., 3DExperience). Skilled at unifying development tools (Python, Git, CI/CD) with AI integration and cloud solutions to boost efficiency and collaboration across teams of any industry.

## ⭐ Platform Highlight  
> **PyJimmy — Engineering-as-Code**  
> Built and launched a proprietary platform that centralises models, simulations, planning and documentation in a single Git repository.  
> - 🔄 **Automated Pipelines**: Any parameter change triggers a 10-minute pipeline to identify impacted assets.  
> - ✅ **Pull-Request Driven**: Review changes, then update all related documents seamlessly.  
> - 🎯 **Lightweight Alternative**: No more black-box PLM—fully transparent, versioned, and integrable with AI tools.

# Projects

Making AI work for complex engineering and technical problems.

---

## Jimmy Energy
**CIO (2022-2025)** • Engineering-as-Code transformation

Transformed traditional engineering company to Git-based workflow. Replaced legacy PLM with custom Python tools (PyJimmy). Entire engineering team now works from unified codebase with version control, CI/CD, and AI integration.

**Impact:** Engineers spend time engineering instead of managing files. Clean, versioned data enables AI workflows.

**Stack:** Python, Git, AWS, GitHub Actions

---

## OmniAgents
[GitHub](https://github.com/charles-azam/OmniAgents) • **Active development**

Unified interface for AI coding agents across execution environments (Local, Docker, E2B) and frameworks (smolagents, Pydantic-AI, LangChain).

**Problem:** AI agent infrastructure is fragmented. Every environment/framework combination needs different code.

**Solution:** Abstract it away. Write agent logic once, run anywhere.

**Stack:** Python, Docker, E2B

---

## Predibench
[Platform](https://predibench.com) • [GitHub](https://github.com/charles-azam/predibench) • [Article](https://huggingface.co/blog/charles-azam/predibench)

Benchmark AI models on real-world prediction markets. Live platform testing if AI can beat humans at forecasting.

**Why it matters:** Most benchmarks use static datasets. Prediction markets provide real-time, real-stakes evaluation.

**Stack:** Python, Polymarket API, RAG

---

## Webportal
[Platform](https://webportal-468213.web.app) • [GitHub](https://github.com/aymeric-roucher/webportal)

Web interface for AI agents. Built at HuggingFace x Anthropic hackathon (3rd place).

**Stack:** Firebase, Web APIs

---

## DeepDraft
[Website](https://deepdraft.dev) • **Work in progress**

AI tool for technical documentation—design docs, reports, diagrams, plans. Deep search specialized in scientific questions.

**Challenge:** Most AI writing tools work for blog posts. Technical documentation needs engineering and scientific reasoning.

**Stack:** Python, RAG, LLM agents

---

## Pyforge
[GitHub](https://github.com/charles-azam/pyforge)

Minimalist Python library for engineering-as-code. Version control for engineering artifacts—models, simulations, docs.

Born from Jimmy Energy transformation. Codifies patterns for treating engineering like software.

**Stack:** Python, Git

---

## AIEngineer
[GitHub](https://github.com/charles-azam/aiengineer)

AI agent that scaffolds engineering projects following Pyforge conventions. Uses Aider to programmatically generate code.

**Status:** Experimental—testing what AI can handle for complex engineering tasks.

**Stack:** Python, Aider, Pyforge

# Projects

Welcome to my personal projects page.

Based on what I learned at Jimmy, I had an idea. We already managed to do engineering using only open source technologies; python git, ect...

Now, what if I could use an AI agent to create an engineering project automatically ?

To do that, I had to develop two independent repositories:

- [Pyforge](https://github.com/charles-azam/pyforge): a minimalist python library for engineering as code
- [AIEngineer](https://github.com/charles-azam/aiengineer): since it is possible to do engineering as code, why not use an AI Agent to generate it ?

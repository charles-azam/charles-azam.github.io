## Why AI for Your Business?

SMEs face many challenges:

* **Repetitive and time-consuming tasks**
* **Decisions based on gut feeling**, due to lack of reliable data
* **Strong competitive pressure and shrinking margins**
* **Lack of real-time visibility over operations**
* **Unstructured information** that is hard to analyze, yet full of value

In the past, automation meant deploying ERP systems â€” complex, expensive, and high-risk. GIFI, for instance, collapsed after a poorly managed ERP migration.

> âœ… **Today, AI enables **non-invasive automation** â€” fast to implement, efficient, and easy to maintain.**

Most projects can be completed in just a few weeks. The real challenge isnâ€™t technical â€” itâ€™s strategic: knowing **whatâ€™s possible**, **what creates impact**, and **how to implement it with minimal risk**. Thatâ€™s exactly what I bring to the table.

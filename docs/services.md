# Consulting

I occasionally work with companies on AI and automation projects, particularly in traditional industries looking to modernize their technical workflows.

## What I Bring

**Real experience transforming engineering workflows.** As CIO at Jimmy Energy, I led the transition from legacy PLM systems to a modern, code-driven engineering platform. I understand both the technical challenges and organizational dynamics of adopting AI in traditional industries.

**Focus on production systems, not demos.** My projects (Predibench, Webportal, OmniAgents) are live systems with real users. I build for production, not proof-of-concept.

**Expertise in:**
- AI agent infrastructure and deployment
- Engineering-as-Code transformations
- RAG systems for technical domains
- DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud architecture
- Team leadership and technical roadmapping

## Approach

### 1. Understand the Real Problem

* Immersion in your actual workflows
* Identify high-impact opportunities
* Focus on what creates measurable value

### 2. Iterative Development

* Ship working prototypes quickly
* Weekly deliverables and feedback loops
* On-site collaboration when needed

### 3. Production Deployment

* Deploy without disrupting operations
* Train your team to own the system
* Documentation and post-deployment support

**Philosophy:** Build solutions your team actually uses and understands.

## Current Focus

I'm primarily focused on building open-source tools and working on hard technical problems in AI. Consulting engagements are selective—I work with projects that align with my interest in making AI succeed at complex engineering and technical tasks.

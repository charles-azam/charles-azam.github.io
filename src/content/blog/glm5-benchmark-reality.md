**TL;DR:** GLM-5 tops coding benchmarks. I tested it on an unpublished NP-hard optimization problem (KIRO) and 89-task Terminal-Bench. Best case: competitive. Typical case: 30% invalid output, every trial timed out, and two identical runs could produce a valid solution or complete garbage. Zhipu AI reports 56% on Terminal-Bench; I got 40%.

## The pitch

GLM-5, from Zhipu AI, is an open-source (MIT) model claiming [77.8% on SWE-bench Verified and 56.2% on Terminal-Bench 2.0](https://z.ai/). Its API is Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible, so you can plug it into existing agent frameworks. And Zhipu AI's Coding Plan subscription ($60/month, extremely generous token limits) makes it cheap to burn tokens at scale -- ideal for systematic testing.

I ran two benchmarks: KIRO, an unpublished NP-hard fiber optic network optimization problem that I'm certain is not in any training data, and Terminal-Bench, a public 89-task coding benchmark. I wanted to see if the numbers hold up.

## How I tested GLM-5

I ran GLM-5 through two agent frameworks (scaffoldings):

- **Claude Code** -- Anthropic's CLI agent. Point it at the API endpoint, set the model name, go. The "official" way to run a model through an agent.
- **Mistral Vibe** -- my fork of Mistral's Vibe CLI, adapted for GLM-5. In previous testing, Mistral Vibe was the easiest codebase to fork and showed the strongest results across frameworks on Terminal-Bench. [Mistral-vibe-zai](https://github.com/charles-azam/mistral-vibe-zai)

Both frameworks ran on the same two benchmarks:

**KIRO** -- an NP-hard fiber optic network optimization problem I solved by hand eight years ago as an engineering student. Never published online, returns a continuous score (lower is better) instead of pass/fail. In a [previous article](https://charlesazam.com/blog/kiro-benchmark/), I ran four CLI agents on it (Claude Code/Opus 4.6, Codex/GPT-5.3, Gemini CLI, Mistral/Devstral-2). Same five conditions (base, +keep improving, +target hint, Go, one hour), three trials each, same Docker containers via [Harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor).

**Terminal-Bench** -- an 89-task coding benchmark covering everything from building POV-Ray to COBOL modernization to cracking 7z hashes. [Terminal-Bench](https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench)

## The headline numbers look fine

On KIRO, GLM-5 slots into the middle of the pack -- competitive but not at the top. Claude Code + GLM-5 (40,943) lands right next to Gemini CLI (41,119). Mistral Vibe + GLM-5 (46,764) comfortably beats Devstral-2 (53,616).

![Terminal-Bench task outcomes](../../assets/blog/glm5-benchmark-reality/glm5_tb_outcomes.png)

On Terminal-Bench, Mistral Vibe + GLM-5 solved 43 out of 89 tasks (48.3%). Claude Code + GLM-5 solved 36 out of 88 (40.4%). These are respectable numbers. If I stopped here, I'd write "GLM-5 is competitive."

I didn't stop here.

## The numbers behind the numbers

**30% of KIRO trials produced completely invalid output.** Out of 27 completed trials, 8 scored 999,999,999 (the penalty for constraint violations). For comparison, the original four agents failed on 15% of trials. Every single experimental condition -- base, keep improving, target hint, Go, one hour -- produced at least one failure for both frameworks.

**Every single KIRO trial hit the timeout.** Even the valid ones. The agents were always interrupted mid-work, never finishing cleanly. With the original agents, several trials completed well within the time limit -- Gemini CLI often finished in under 5 minutes of a 30-minute window. GLM-5 never did.

**Variance was insane.** Two runs of the exact same condition could produce a valid solution or complete garbage. Claude Code + GLM-5's target hint trials: 58,045 and 999,999,999 (invalid). With the original agents, variance within a condition was typically under 30%.

**The Go condition was catastrophic.** Claude Code + GLM-5's Go run had to be cancelled entirely after the first trial scored 999,999,999 and the second had to be force-killed mid-run. Mistral Vibe + GLM-5 Go trials scored 296,978 (valid but abysmal), 999,999,999 (invalid), and 97,539. The agents spent their time writing and rewriting Go code, not optimizing.

**On Terminal-Bench, nearly a quarter of tasks timed out.** Claude Code + GLM-5 timed out on 24 of 88 tasks (27%). Mistral Vibe + GLM-5 timed out on 21 of 89 (24%).

### Why my Terminal-Bench scores differ from Zhipu AI's

![Terminal-Bench: official benchmarks vs. real-world testing](../../assets/blog/glm5-benchmark-reality/glm5_tb_gap.png)

Zhipu AI [reports 56.2% on Terminal-Bench with Claude Code](https://zhipuai.cn/) -- or 61.1% on their verified dataset. I got 40.4%. That's a massive gap for the same model on the same benchmark. The difference comes down to testing conditions, and reading the footnotes of their blog post explains most of it:

- **No wall-clock time limits.** Zhipu AI's evaluation "remove[s] wall-clock time limits, while preserving per-task CPU and memory constraints." My benchmark has real time limits -- the same ones any user would face. Given that 27% of my Claude Code tasks timed out, removing time limits alone could explain most of the gap.
- **API access vs. Coding Plan subscription.** I used the Coding Plan subscription ($60/month). Subscription requests are slower than direct API calls -- a request that takes a few extra seconds cascades into fewer iterations within the same time window. Zhipu AI's evaluation likely used their own infrastructure with no such bottleneck.
- **Verified dataset.** Zhipu AI also reports results on "a verified Terminal-Bench 2.0 dataset that resolves ambiguous instructions," which boosted their score from 56.2% to 61.1%.
- **Think mode with tuned parameters.** They used Claude Code 2.1.14 in think mode with temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, max_new_tokens=65536. My runs used default settings through the Coding Plan.

None of this is dishonest -- Zhipu AI discloses their methodology in the footnotes. But it means their headline number (56-61%) represents ideal conditions that a typical user with a Coding Plan subscription won't replicate. My 40.4% is closer to what you'd actually experience.

## What the trajectories show

I read through the agent traces. GLM-5 isn't dumb -- it knows the right algorithms and approaches the problem sensibly. The issue is execution depth and reliability.

**Claude Code + GLM-5** took 90 steps in its best run (40,943, one-hour condition). It went through six solver versions, starting at 97,796 and iterating down through multiple approaches -- basic heuristics, multi-start methods, MST-based chains, k-means clustering. But it hit a plateau:

> "The solver is consistently getting 40943. Let me run a few more times and then summarize."

Compare this to Claude Code + Opus 4.6, which in its best run wrote and rewrote its solver four times, invented a destroy-and-repair perturbation strategy to escape local minima, and kept finding improvements all the way down to 34,061. GLM-5 identified the right general approach but couldn't push through to the next level of sophistication.

**Mistral Vibe + GLM-5** was faster but shallower -- 34 steps versus 90. It tried multiple construction heuristics with 2-opt improvement and iterated aggressively (81,397 → 58,544 → 46,764), but ran out of time before closing the gap. With only 34 steps, it simply couldn't iterate enough. This is not surprising, it is a very simple tool with simple prompts (simple is usually better).

## The framework matters

An interesting side-finding: the same model produced different results depending on which agent framework ran it.

| Benchmark | Claude Code + GLM-5 | Mistral Vibe + GLM-5 |
|---|---|---|
| KIRO (best) | **40,943** | 46,764 |
| Terminal-Bench | 36/88 (40.4%) | **43/89 (48.3%)** |

Claude Code's deeper iteration loop helped on the sustained optimization problem (KIRO). Mistral Vibe's lighter approach won on diverse task completion (Terminal-Bench). The two agents solved different subsets of Terminal-Bench tasks: 30 tasks solved by both, 13 uniquely by Mistral Vibe, 6 uniquely by Claude Code.

The agent around the model shapes how its intelligence gets applied. Same weights, different results.

## What this means

GLM-5 is not a bad model. Its best-case KIRO score of 40,943 is genuinely competitive with Gemini CLI. It knows the right algorithms, approaches problems sensibly, and through the right framework can solve a decent range of coding tasks.

But competitive best-case performance is not the same as reliable performance. The original agents -- each running their native model -- had a 15% invalid rate on KIRO. GLM-5 had 30%. The original agents sometimes finished early. GLM-5 always timed out. The original agents had moderate variance. GLM-5's variance was wild.

This is the gap that standard benchmarks don't capture. SWE-bench tells you the pass rate across a curated set of tasks. Terminal-Bench with no time limits tells you what's possible under ideal conditions. Neither tells you that a third of your real runs might produce garbage, or that two identical runs can produce a valid solution or nonsense, or that the model will always run out of time even on tasks where competitors finish in minutes.

Zhipu AI reports 56-61% on Terminal-Bench. I got 40%. Both numbers are real -- they just measure different things. Theirs measures the model's ceiling. Mine measures the user's floor.

When I pick a model for real work, I don't care about the best score on the best day. I care about the worst score on a normal day. By that metric, GLM-5 has a way to go.

## Another reason why it failed

In a [separate article](https://charlesazam.com/blog/deepdive-benchmark/), I found that agents handle file editing in wildly different ways: custom patch DSLs, SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, 9-strategy fuzzy matching cascades, LLM-based self-correction fallbacks. Each format works well for the model fine-tuned on it -- Codex's patches are trained into GPT, Claude Code's edit tool is trained into Claude. A general-purpose model like GLM-5 sees these formats cold in the system prompt. When it produces a slightly malformed edit, the agent retries, tokens burn, and the clock runs out.

GLM-5 is open-source (MIT License, weights on HuggingFace) -- which means this is fixable. The agent scaffolding is the fine-tuning surface. Generate trajectories through your own agent loop, fine-tune the model on them. The reason native models work so well in their native agents isn't just model quality -- it's that the model has been trained on the exact interface it uses in production. The gap between 40% and 60% on Terminal-Bench might not require a better model -- just one fine-tuned on the agent it runs in.
